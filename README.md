# Predictive-Analysis-using-OkCupid-Dataset
This modular project aims to explore the OKCupid dataset, a vast collection of data on people's interests, lifestyles, and personal characteristics. The project involves data loading, exploration, and cleaning, followed by the use of machine learning models to forecast outcomes. The project also includes a unique sex prediction task based on wealth and educational attainment. The final deliverables include a comprehensive model comparison and evaluation, coding in a Jupyter Notebook, a detailed project report, and presentation slides for stakeholder engagement. The ultimate goal is to provide insights into variables affecting Zodiac sign, body type, wealth, and gender forecasts on OKCupid, and to improve understanding of user preferences and behaviors in online dating scenarios.
